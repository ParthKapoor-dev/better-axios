# 👋 Welcome to `better-axios`

`better-axios` is a lightweight and powerful wrapper around [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) that helps you write cleaner, more consistent API calls across your frontend or backend projects.

### 🚀 Why use better-axios?

- ✅ Unified request/response types (`ApiResponse`, `ApiError`)
- 🔐 Easy token management (`setAuthToken`, `removeAuthToken`)
- ⚙️ Global success & error handlers
- 🧩 Easily extendable Axios instance
- 📦 Works with React, Next.js, Node.js, etc.

### 🎯 Goal

The goal is to **abstract away repetitive axios boilerplate**, make it **type-safe**, and provide a plug-and-play interface for building API layers in TypeScript projects.

---

## ✨ Example Use

```ts
import { AxiosApi } from "better-axios";

const api = new AxiosApi({ baseURL: "https://api.example.com" });

const result = await api.get("/users");

if (result.success) {
  console.log(result.data); // ✅ success
} else {
  console.error(result.error.message); // ❌ error
}

```
